The **CREATE A NEW TEAM** button appears if no TrueCommand teams exist.
When teams are present, the **JOIN TEAM** button appears.
Click **JOIN TEAM** to add the user to a team.
You can add users to multiple teams.
TrueCommand applies team permissions to any user added to a team, but setting a specific permission for the user can override a related team permission.
Team Configuration can be accomplished in the [Team Page]({{< relref "/TrueCommand/GettingStarted/AddTeams.md" >}})
