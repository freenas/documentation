Groups are collections of systems that are organized by TrueCommand administrators.
Grouping systems allows you to efficiently manage system permissions and reporting.

Open the **System Groups** tab to view the list of created groups and the systems they contain.
Create a Group by clicking **Configure <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Settings">settings</i>&nbsp; > Systems > + NEW GROUP**.
Enter a name for the new group and click *ADD SYSTEM* to add a system to the group.
When you've added all the desired systems to the group, click *CREATE GROUP*.
