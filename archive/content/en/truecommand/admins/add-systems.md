## Connecting Systems to TrueCommand

To connect a system to TrueCommand, open the **Configure** <i class="fa fa-cog" aria-hidden="true" title="Settings"></i>&nbsp; menu and click **Systems**.
This menu is organized into two tabs: **Systems** and **System Groups**.
These tabs contain all the options to connect and organize systems in TrueCommand.
All added systems are listed in the **Systems** tab with the current connection status.

### Adding a System Manually

To connect a new system, click **+ NEW SYSTEM**.

Enter the system IP address or DNS hostname, nickname, and password.
If a mistake is made, the contents of the fields can be reset by clicking **RESET FORM**.

### Adjusting Systems

Systems that have been misconfigured with something like an incorrect password show as offline in both the TrueCommand **Dashboard** and **Systems** list.

You can edit a system from the systems list and enter new connection details. To go back to the original contents of the fields, click RESET FORM.

To remove a system from TrueCommand monitoring, click delete.

## Organizing Systems into Groups

Groups are collections of systems that are organized by TrueCommand administrators.
Grouping systems allows efficient management of system permissions and reporting.

Open the **System Groups** tab to view the list of created groups and the systems they contain.
Groups are created by clicking **Configure** <i class="fa fa-cog" aria-hidden="true" title="gear"></i>&nbsp; > Systems > + NEW GROUP**.
Enter a name for the new group and click **ADD SYSTEM** to add a system to the group.
When all the desired systems are added to the group, click **CREATE GROUP**.

Editing a group allows updating the group name or changing which systems are members of that group.

To delete a system group, click **Delete** <i class="fa fa-trash" aria-hidden="true" title="Delete"></i>. Confirm the deletion by clicking **YES**.
