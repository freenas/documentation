The **Administration** page shows additional system details and offers a variety of TrueCommand configuration options.
This page is available to users with administrator permissions by opening the **Configure** <i class="fa fa-cog" aria-hidden="true" title="Settings"></i>&nbsp; menu and clicking **Administration**.
The page is organized into **About**, **Certificates**, and **Configuration** tabs.

## About TrueCommand

The **About** tab contains the current TrueCommand system ID and version, license details, and contact information for iXsystems.

### Updating the License

TrueCommand can be expanded to monitor more disks by upgrading or purchasing a license from iXsystems.
Clicking GET A LICENSE opens a new browser tab to purchase a TrueCommand license.
You can also contact iXsystems to upgrade the current license.

Purchasing or upgrading the License requires uploading the new license to TrueCommand.
Click **Browseâ€¦** to open a file browser on your local system.
Select the new license file to upload and click **UPLOAD LICENSE** to apply the new license to TrueCommand.


## Certificate Management

The **Certificates** tab shows the certificates and Certificate Authorities (CAs) used by TrueCommand and has options to upload or import a certificate or CA.

Clicking **Browse...** opens a dialog to upload a file from the local system.
Selecting **Plain text** allows copying and pasting the file raw text instead of uploading a file.


## General Options, SSL, Alerts, and LDAP

The Configuration tab contains options to configure various features of TrueCommand.

Changing any options requires clicking **SAVE** to save the new system configuration.
To reset fields back to their previous values, click **CANCEL**.

General options include how frequently TrueCommand measures systems statistics, how long to store system statistics, and the number of database backups from an iXsystems NAS to store.

### SSL options

This section has options to configure secure connections.
By default, TrueCommand attempts an SSL connection, then a non-SSL connection if the first attempt fails.
You can disable non-SSL connection attempts by setting *Require SSL for all connections*.
This is useful when a monitored system does not allow SSL-secured access or if the monitored system is using a custom port.

There are additional options to configure how TrueCommand handles certificates. By default, TrueCommand accepts self-signed certificates and certificate hostname mismatches.
This allows the first-time login to TrueCommand and accepting certificates from systems that use a hostname, but are registered in TrueCommand with an IP address (or vice-versa).

### Alert Options

You can adjust the level of alert that TrueCommand will show from a connected NAS to tune the system messages shown according to your use case.
Choose an alert category to ignore. Multiple categories can be selected.

### LDAP

TrueCommand supports using [LDAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol) to better integrate within an established network environment.
To configure LDAP, add an LDAP server IP address or DNS hostname, fill in the Domain, and click **ADD SERVER**.
Multiple LDAP servers and Domains can be added.

By enabling the "Allow LDAP user creation" option, TrueCommand will create user accounts when someone logs in to the User Interface with their LDAP credentials.
You can also use **JOIN TEAM** to have LDAP users automatically added to specific TrueCommand teams.
