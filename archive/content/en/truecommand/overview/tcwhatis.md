TrueCommand is a single Pane-of-Glass management application that takes the repetitive work out of multi-TrueNAS management by centralizing system alerts, reports, and analytics in one easy to use interface.
It supports users and teams with 24x365 global operations, role-based access control, and a full log of every TrueNAS configuration change.
TrueCommand runs on docker, VMs, or as a cloud service and is free to users with less than 50 drives and affordable for those with larger installations.
