#### Description
Create a new report. The user who creates the report is always included in the "owners" list for the report, and is granted full edit/delete permissions for the report in the future. In addition, the owner of a report is able to share the report with other users/teams on a read-only basis, or grant ownership of a report to other users for edit capabilities as well.

TrueCommand Administrators have permission to edit all reports, even if they are not explicitly included in the "owners" list.

### Input Arguments
* Required:
   * "name" (string) : Visible title to be shown for the report.
* Optional:
   * "owners" (string or Json Array of strings) : User ID's for those who are granted edit permission for this report.
      * Note: The middleware ensures that the user editing the report always keeps ownership of the report.
      * The word "all" can be provided in order to grant edit permission to all users.
   * "shared_users" (string or Json Array of strings) : User ID's for those who are granted read access for this report.
      * Note: The word "all" can be used in place of a user ID in order to grant access to all users. 
   * "shared_teams" (string or Json Array of strings) : Team ID's for those who are granted read access for this report.
      * Note: The word "all" can be used in place of a team ID in order to grant access to all teams. 
   * "widgets" (Json Object) : Special data object for defining the visible widgets for this report.
      * See the {{< api-link "reporting" >}} page for full details.
