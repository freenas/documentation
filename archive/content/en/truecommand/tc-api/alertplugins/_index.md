## API Class: alertplugins
When an alert rule is triggered, it is possible for TrueCommand to be able to forward that alert notification to external notification service providers via a plugin-based provider system. These plugins are independantly created and maintained and may be installed, removed, or updated within TrueCommand as desired.

### Official Plugin Repository
By default, TrueCommand only points to the official ix-alertme plugin repository which is located on GitHub.
It is possible to submit bug tickets or even brand-new notification plugins via the open-source project.
