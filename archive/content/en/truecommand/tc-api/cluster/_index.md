## API Class: cluster

### Cluster management interactions.

This namespace is for API interactions that cross the boundaries of individual NAS systems. Some examples would be to issue a change request to an entire group of systems instead of performing the change individually, or to have one system send data over to another system with TrueCommand setting up the entire operation.
