| Command or Script | string         | When *Command* is selected, enter the command with any options. When *Script* is selected, click <i class="fa fa-folder" aria-hidden="true" title="folder"></i>&nbsp (Browse) to select the script from an existing pool. |
| When              | drop-down menu | Select when the *Command* or *Script* runs: *Pre Init*: early in the boot process, after mounting filesystems and starting networking. *Post Init*: at the end of the boot process, before TrueNAS services start. *Shutdown*: during the system power off process. |
| Enabled           | checkbox       | Enable this task. Unset to disable the task without deleting it. |
| Timeout           | integer        | Automatically stop the script or command after the specified number of seconds.  |

Scheduled commands must be in the default path.
The full path to the command can also be included in the entry.
The path can be tested with **which {commandname}** in the **Shell**.
When available, the path to the command is shown:

```
[root@freenas ~]# which ls
/bin/ls
```

When scheduling a script, test the script first to verify it is executable and achieves the desired results.
