An Access Control List (ACL) is a set of account permissions associated with a dataset and applied to directories or files within that dataset.
These permissions control the actions users can perform on the dataset contents.
ACLs are typically used to manage user interactions with shared datasets and are created when a dataset is added to a pool.

## ACL Creation

When creating a dataset, you can choose how the ACL can be modified by selecting an *ACL Mode*:

* *Passthrough* only updates ACL entries (ACEs) that are related to the file or directory mode.

* *Restricted* does not allow `chmod` to make changes to files or directories with a non-trivial ACL.
  An ACL is trivial if it can be fully expressed as a file mode without losing any access rules.
  Setting the ACL Mode to Restricted is typically used to optimize a dataset for SMB sharing, but can require further optimizations.
  For example, configuring an rsync task with this dataset could require adding `--no-perms` as an extra option for the task.

To view an ACL, go to **Storage > Pools** and click the *Edit Permissions* option for a nested dataset within a pool.

### ACL Inheritance

The ACL for a new file or directory is typically inherited from the parent directory and is preserved when it is moved or renamed within the same dataset.
An exception is when there are no *File Inherit* or *Directory Inherit* flags in the parent ACL *owner@*, *group@*, or *everyone@* entries.
These non-inheriting entries are added to the ACL of the newly created file or directory based on the [Samba](https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Main_Page) create and directory masks or the [umask](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=umask&sektion=2) value.

## Basic Permissions Editor

The **Permissions Editor** option will allow basic adjustments to a datasets ACL.

## ACL Manager - Editing an ACL

Click the **ACL Manager** button to adjust file ownership or account permissions to the dataset. The first time the ACL Manager is accessed a screen pops up that with basic presets or custom acl settings. Once they have been set you can go back anytime to adjust your ACL's.

Choose **Select a preset ACL** and choose a preset. The preset options are OPEN, RESTRICTED, or HOME.

Choose **Create a custom ACL** to create a new list of customized permissions.

### Ownership

The selected *User* controls the dataset and always has permission to modify the ACL and other attributes.
The selected *Group* also controls the dataset, but can have permissions changed by adding or modifying a `group@` ACE.
Any user accounts or groups imported from a directory service can be selected as the primary *User* or *Group*.

### ACEs

You can quickly apply a standardized ACL with preconfigured Access Control List Entries (ACEs) by choosing one of the *Default ACL Options*.
Otherwise, add a new item to the ACL, define *Who* the ACE applies to, and configure permissions and inheritance flags for the ACE.

To view an ACL information from the console, go to **System Settings > Shell** and enter command:

```shell
getfacl /mnt/path/to/dataset
```

#### Permissions

Permissions are divided between Basic and Advanced options.
The basic options are commonly used groups of the advanced options.

**Basic Permissions**

* *Read* (`r-x---a-R-c---`): view file or directory contents, attributes, named attributes, and ACL.
  Includes the *Traverse* permission.
* *Modify* (`rwxpDdaARWc--s`): adjust file or directory contents, attributes, and named attributes.
  Create new files or subdirectories.
  Includes the *Traverse* permission.
  Changing the ACL contents or owner is not allowed.
* *Traverse* (`--x---a-R-c---`): Execute a file or move through a directory.
  Directory contents are restricted from view unless the *Read* permission is also applied.
  To traverse and view files in a directory, but not be able to open individual files, set the *Traverse* and *Read* permissions, then add the advanced *Directory Inherit* flag.
* *Full Control* (`rwxpDdaARWcCos`): Apply all permissions.

**Advanced Permissions**

* *Read Data* (`r`): View file contents or list directory contents.
* *Write Data* (`w`): Create new files or modify any part of a file.
* *Append Data* (`p`): Add new data to the end of a file.
* *Read Named Attributes* (`R`): view the named attributes directory.
* *Write Named Attributes* (`W`): create a named attribute directory. Must be paired with the Read Named Attributes permission.
* *Execute* (`x`): Execute a file, move through, or search a directory.
* *Delete Children* (`D`): delete files or subdirectories from inside a directory.
* *Read Attributes* (`a`): view file or directory non-ACL attributes.
* *Write Attributes* (`A`): change file or directory non-ACL attributes.
* *Delete* (`d`): remove the file or directory.
* *Read ACL* (`c`): view the ACL.
* *Write ACL* (`C`): change the ACL and the ACL mode.
* *Write Owner* (`o`): change the user and group owners of the file or directory.
* *Synchronize* (`s`): synchronous file read/write with the server. This permission does not apply to FreeBSD clients.

#### Inheritance Flags

Basic inheritance flags only enable or disable ACE inheritance.
Advanced flags offer finer control for applying an ACE to new files or directories.

**Basic Flags**

* *Inherit* (`fd-----`): enable ACE inheritance.
* *No Inherit* (`-------`): disable ACE inheritance.

**Advanced Flags**

* *File Inherit* (`f`): The ACE is inherited with subdirectories and files. It applies to new files.
* *Directory Inherit* (`d`): new subdirectories inherit the full ACE.
* *No Propagate Inherit* (`n`): The ACE can only be inherited once.
* *Inherit Only* (`i`): Remove the ACE from permission checks but allow it to be inherited by new files or subdirectories. Inherit Only is removed from these new objects.
* *Inherited* (`I`): set when the ACE has been inherited from another dataset.
