A scrub is the process of ZFS scanning through the data on a pool. Scrubs help to identify data integrity problems, detect silent data corruptions caused by transient hardware issues, and provide early alerts of impending disk failures.

By default, TrueNAS creates a scrub task when new pool is created. The default schedule for a scrub is to run every Sunday at 12:00 AM. To edit the default scrub, go to **Tasks > Scrub Tasks** and click <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v" aria-hidden="true" title="Options"></i>.

To create additional scrub tasks, you must first <a href="/hub/initial-setup/storage/pools/">create a pool</a>.

## Create Scrub Task

To create a scrub task for a pool, go to **Tasks > Scrub Tasks** and click *ADD*. First, select a pool for the scrub task. Enter a number for the *Threshhold days*. The *Threshhold days* are the number of days before a completed scrub is allowed to run again. This controls the task schedule. For example, scheduling a scrub to run daily and setting *Threshold days* to 7 means the scrub attempts to run daily. When the scrub is successful, it continues to check daily but does not run again until seven days have elapsed. Using a multiple of seven ensures the scrub always occurs on the same weekday.

Select a schedule for the scrub task. If a custom schedule is desired, select *Custom* and fill out the custom scheduler to meet your needs. The custom scheduler can accept standard [cron input strings](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=crontab&sektion=5) for the *Minutes*, *Hours*, and *Days*. Unsetting *Enabled* only disables the schedule. You can still save the scrub task and enable it later.
