Resilvering, or the process of copying data to a replacement disk, is best completed as quickly as possible.
Increasing the priority of resilvers can help them to complete more quickly.
The Resilver Priority menu makes it possible to increase the priority of resilvering at times where the additional I/O or CPU usage will not affect normal usage.

Go to **Tasks > Resilver Priority** to configure the priority to a time that most effective for your environment.
