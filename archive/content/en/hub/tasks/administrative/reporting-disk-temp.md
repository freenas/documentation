TrueNAS reports the temperature of all active disks in the system. To view these reports, go to **Reporting** and select the *Disk* option from the drop-down on the top left of the page.

The default view shows a temperature graph of the first disk. To see the temperature graphs of more disks, select them from the *DEVICES* drop-down. To view other metrics such as *Disk I/O* and *Disk Latency*, select them from the *METRICS* drop-down.

Graphs can be interacted with by clicking and dragging on a certain range, or by clicking <i class="fas fa-search-plus" aria-hidden="true" title="Search Plus"></i>, <i class="fas fa-search-minus" aria-hidden="true" title="Search Minus"></i>, <i class="fas fa-forward" aria-hidden="true" title="Forward"></i>, or <i class="fas fa-backward" aria-hidden="true" title="Backward"></i>. 

To learn more about the reporting settings, see [Configuring System Reporting]({{< relref "system-reporting.md" >}}).
