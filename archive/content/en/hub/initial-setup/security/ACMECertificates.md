[Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME)](https://ietf-wg-acme.github.io/acme/draft-ietf-acme-acme.html) is available for automating certificate issuing and renewal.
The user must verify ownership of the domain before certificate automation is allowed.

To configure ACME certificate automation, you will need to add an ACME DNS authenticator to TrueNAS and have a [Certificate Signing Request](/hub/initial-setup/security/certificates/#certificate-signing-request) on the system.

## ACME DNS Authenticators

Go to **System > ACME DNS** and click **ADD**.

Enter a name for the authenticator.
This is only used to identify the authenticator in the TrueNAS web interface.
Choose a DNS provider and configure any required *Authenticator Attributes*:

* Route 53: Amazon DNS web service. Requires entering an Amazon account **Access ID Key** and **Secret Access Key**. See the [AWS documentation]() for more details about generating these keys.

Click **SUBMIT** to register the DNS Authenticator and add it to the list of authenticator options for ACME Certificates.

## Creating ACME Certificates

ACME certificates can be created for existing certificate signing requests.
These certificates use an ACME DNS authenticator to confirm domain ownership, then are automatically issued and renewed.
To create a new ACME certificate, go to **System > Certificates**, click <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v" aria-hidden="true" title="Options"></i> (Options) for an existing certificate signing request, and click **Create ACME Certificate**.
