After setting up storage, it is recommended to configure the alert system with an email address and then customize how alerts are reported and which alerts are displayed or prioritized.

## Alert Services

Alert Services are the various methods built into to TrueNAS that can notify you of a system alert. Note that some of these services are third-party services that might charge for message or data usage.

To add a new alert service, go to **System > Alert Services > ADD**.

<br><br>

Enter a **Name** for the alert service and select the **Type**.
Next, decide on the severity of the alert and select an alert **Level** from the drop-down.
Finally, enter the authentication information for the alert service.
You can test the service configuration by clicking **SEND TEST ALERT**.

## Alert Settings

To modify the default system alerts, go to **System > Alert Settings**.

<br><br>

The alerts are grouped into sections based on type.
For example, alerts that are related to pools appear in the *Storage* alert section.

Each alert warning level and frequency can be changed.
To customize alert importance, use the *Warning Level* drop-down.
To adjust how often alert notifications are sent, use the *Frequency* drop-down.
Setting the *Frequency* to *NEVER* prevents that alert from being added to alert notifications, but the alert will still show in the web interface if it is triggered.

To configure where alert notifications are sent, use **Alert Services**.

## System Alerts

The alert system provides a visual warning when system conditions require administrative attention.
The alert icon in the upper right corner has a notification badge that displays the total number of unread alerts.

### Alert Levels

Alert icons indicate notification, warning, critical, and one-shot critical alerts. Critical messages are also emailed to the root account. One-shot critical alerts must be dismissed by the user.

| Alert Level       | Icon |   |
|-------------------|------|---|
| Notification      | <i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>    |   |
| Warning           | <i class="fas fa-clock" aria-hidden="true"></i>  |   |
| Critical          | <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>    |   |
| One-shot Critical | <i class="fa fa-bell" aria-hidden="true"></i>   |   |

## Email

An automatic script sends a nightly email to the administrator (root) account containing important information such as the health of the disks.
Alert events are also emailed to the root user account.


> [Scrub Task](/hub/tasks/scheduled/scrub/) issues and [S.M.A.R.T. reports](/hub/tasks/scheduled/smart/) are mailed separately to the address configured in those services.

The administrator typically does not read emails directly on the system.
These emails are usually sent to an external email address where they can be read more conveniently.
It is important to configure the system to send these emails to the administratorâ€™s remote email account so critical issues can be quickly resolved.

The first step is to set the remote address to send system emails.
Go to **Accounts > Users**, click <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v" aria-hidden="true" title="Options"></i>&nbsp; (Options) and **Edit** for the `root` user.
In the **Email** field, enter a remote email address that is regularly monitored by the system administrator, like *admin@example.com* and click **SAVE**.

Additional configuration is done from **System > Email**.

Set the address the email will come from, along with the From Name.  Enter the mail server address and the correct port.  Select the desired security option, and enable SMTP and enter the credentials if necessary.


### SMTP Authentication Settings

|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Outgoing Mail Server | string or IP address | Hostname or IP address of SMTP server used for sending this email.                                                                                                           |
| Mail Server Port     | integer              | SMTP port number. Typically `25`/`465` (secure SMTP), or `587` (submission).                                                                                                 |
| Security             | drop-down menu       | Choose an encryption type. Choices are *Plain (No Encryption)*, *SSL (Implicit TLS)*, or *TLS (STARTTLS)*.                                                                   |
| Username             | string               | Enter the SMTP username when the SMTP server requires authentication.                                                                                                        |
| Password             | string               | Enter the SMTP account password if needed for authentication. Only plain text characters (7-bit ASCII) are allowed in passwords. UTF or composed characters are not allowed. |


Click the **SEND TEST MAIL** button to verify that the configured email settings are working. If the test email fails, double-check that the *Email* field of the root user is correctly configured by clicking the **Edit** button for the root account in **Accounts > Users**.

## SNMP

[SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1157) is used to monitor network-attached devices for conditions that warrant administrative attention.
TrueNAS uses [Net-SNMP](http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/) to provide SNMP.
To configure SNMP, go to the **Services** page, find the **SNMP** row, and click <i class="fas fa-pen" aria-hidden="true" title="Configure"></i> (Configure).

When starting the SNMP service, port `UDP 161` is enabled to listen for SNMP requests.
Available Management Information Bases (MIBs) are located in `/usr/local/share/snmp/mibs`.
Here is a sample of the directory contents:
