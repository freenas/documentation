After installing TrueNAS, configuring and using the system is all managed through the web interface.
It is important to only use the web interface to make configuration changes to the system.
By default, using the command-line interface (CLI) to modify the system **does not modify the settings database**.
Any changes made in the command line are lost and reverted to the original database settings whenever the system restarts.
TrueNAS automatically creates a number of ways to access the web interface, but you might need to adjust the default settings to better fit the system in your network environment.

{{% alert title="Preconfigured Systems" color="info" %}}
When you purchase TrueNAS Enterprise hardware from iXsystems, the system is preconfigured with your provided networking details.
The IP address of the TrueNAS web interface is provided on the system sales order or configuration sheet.
Please [contact iX Support](/hub/initial-setup/support/#contacting-ixsystems-support) if the TrueNAS web interface IP address has not been provided with these documents or cannot be identified from the TrueNAS system console.

To configure access to the web interface or view the web interface IP address, you will need to connect a monitor and keyboard to your TrueNAS system or connect with IPMI for out-of-band system management.

## Default Access to the Web Interface

When powering on a TrueNAS system, the system attempts to connect to a DHCP server from all live interfaces and provide access to the web interface.
On networks that support Multicast Domain Name Services (mDNS), a hostname and domain can be used to access the TrueNAS web interface.
By default, TrueNAS is configured to use the hostname and domain *truenas.local*
You can change this after logging in to the web interface by going to **Network > Global Configuration** and setting a new *Hostname* and *Domain*.

If an IP address is needed, connect a monitor to the TrueNAS system and view the console setup menu that displays at the end of the boot process.

<br><br>

When able to automatically configure a connection, the system shows the web interface IP address at the bottom of the console setup menu.
If needed, you can reset the root password in the TrueNAS console setup menu or by clicking **Settings > Change Password** in the web interface.
To require logging in to the system before showing the system console menu, go to **System > Advanced** and unset *Show Text Console without Password Prompt*.

## Configuring Web Interface Access

If the TrueNAS system is not connected to a network with a DHCP server, you can use the console network configuration menu to manually *Configure Network Interfaces*.
This example shows configuring a single interface, *em0*:

```
Enter an option from 1-12: 1
1) em0
Select an interface (q to quit): 1
Remove the current settings of this interface? (This causes a momentary disconnec
tion of the network.) (y/n) n
Configure interface for DHCP? (y/n) n
Configure IPv4? (y/n) y
Interface name:     (press enter, the name can be blank)
Several input formats are supported
Example 1 CIDR Notation:
    192.168.1.1/24
Example 2 IP and Netmask separate:
    IP: 192.168.1.1
    Netmask: 255.255.255.0, or /24 or 24
IPv4 Address: 192.168.1.108/24
Saving interface configuration: Ok
Configure IPv6? (y/n) n
Restarting network: ok

...

The web user interface is at
http://192.168.1.108
```

Depending on your network environment, you might also need to define your IPv4 or IPv6 default gateway with the *Configure Default Route* option.
*Configure Static Routes* allows adding destination network and gateway IP addresses, one for each route.
To change the DNS domain and add nameservers, select *Configure DNS*.

These settings can also be adjusted later in the various **Network** options available in the web interface.

## Logging In to the Web Interface

On a computer that can access the same network as the TrueNAS system, enter the hostname and domain or IP address in a web browser to connect to the web interface.

<img src="/images/tn-core-login.png">
<br><br>

Only the `root` username is used to log in to the web interface.
Enter the `root` account password that was created during installation.

<!-- Update with how to find the randomly generated password -->
{{% alert title="Root Password on Preconfigured Systems" color="info" %}}
TrueNAS systems purchased from iXsystems use a default password: *abcd1234*

## Web Interface Dashboard

After logging in, the system **Dashboard** is shown.
Basic information about the installed version, systems component usage and network traffic are all presented on this screen.

<img src="/images/Dashboard.png">
<br><br>
    
From the **Dashboard** you can access the management options for the TrueNAS.
Across the top row are links to outside resources and buttons to control the system.
There is also a column of options at the left hand side of the screen for accessing the various TrueNAS Configuration screens.

Logos in the top row are links to iXsystems sites.
The button next to the iXsystems logo will launch [TrueCommand](https://www.ixsystems.com/truecommand/).
TrueCommandÂ® is a "single pane of glass" application to simplify the scaling of data, drive management, and administration of iXsystems NAS platforms.
The next two buttons show information about what is happening on the system, like active or previous tasks and any alerts generated by a system condition.
The remaining buttons link to system configuration option or can be used to logout, restart, or shutdown the physical system.

The top row has buttons to hide the left side column.
The top of this column shows the system hostname and the active user.
TrueNAS configuration screens are linked in the left hand column:

* **Dashboard**: Landing page for the web interface.
* [**Accounts**](/hub/initial-setup/security/accounts/): Add or manage TrueNAS User and Group accounts.
* [**System**](/hub/initial-setup/firsttimelogin/systemsettings/): TrueNAS system level options.
* [**Tasks**](/hub/tasks/scheduled/): Configuring options for scheduled re-occurring operations.
* [**Network**](/hub/initial-setup/networking/): Options for integrating TrueNAS in a network environment.
* [**Storage**](/hub/initial-setup/storage/): How data is added to TrueNAS. Options for configuring pools and datasets on attached hard drives.
* [**Directory Services**](/hub/initial-setup/security/directory-services/): Map network resources to TrueNAS or make the system visible in a network.
* [**Sharing**](/hub/sharing/): Provide data stored in TrueNAS over a network using different built-in protocols.
* **Services**: Tasks that can run in the background of TrueNAS for purposes like data sharing or network access. Services can start automatically or disabled for security. By default, most system services are disabled and are configured as part of enabling different sharing protocols or other system features.
* [**Plugins**](/hub/tasks/advanced/plugins/): Extend the built-in NAS services by installing a pre-packaged application in an isolated Jail.
* [**Jails**](/hub/tasks/advanced/jails/): lightweight operating-system-level virtualization that allows one or multiple services to run isolated from the host TrueNAS system.
* [**Reporting**](/hub/tasks/administrative/system-reporting/): Helpful graphs and information about the system, including hardware, storage, and network utilization.
* [**Virtual Machines**](/hub/tasks/advanced/virtual-machines/): Environment on a host computer that can be used as if it were a separate physical computer.
* **Display System Processes**: Shows actively running system processes, including cpu and memory usage.
* [**Shell**](/hub/tasks/administrative/gui-shell/): Command line interface (CLI) for running diagnostic or other integrated applications as the system administrator. To access the [system console setup menu](#default-access-to-the-web-interface) from the **Shell**, enter `/etc/netcli`.
* **Guide**: Opens a new browser tab to the TrueNAS Documentation Hub.

## Troubleshooting

If the user interface is not accessible by IP address from a browser, check these things:

* Are proxy settings enabled in the browser configuration?
  If so, disable the settings and try connecting again.
* If the page does not load, make sure that a `ping` reaches the TrueNAS system IP address.
  If the address is in a private IP address range, it is only accessible from within that private network.

If the web interface is shown but seems unresponsive or incomplete:

* Make sure the browser allows cookies, Javascript, and custom fonts from the TrueNAS system.
* Try a different browser. Firefox is recommended.

If the UI becomes unresponsive after an upgrade or other system operation, clear the site data and refresh the browser (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd>).
