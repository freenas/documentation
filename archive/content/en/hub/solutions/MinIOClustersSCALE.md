On TrueNAS SCALE 20.12-ALPHA and later, users can create a MinIO S3 distributed instance to scale out and handle individual TrueNAS node failures. In this example, we will be using four physical TrueNAS systems and creating a distributed cluster.
For more information on MinIO distributed setups, please refer to their [documentation](https://docs.min.io/docs/distributed-minio-quickstart-guide.html).

## Creating datasets

Before getting started, create a dataset or other shared directory on your storage pool to be used for the persistent MinIO data (e.g. "/mnt/tank/minio01"). Create datasets across all nodes in advance.

On your first node, go to **Apps > Launch Docker Image**.

<br><br>

First, enter an application name (we picked “minio-distributed").

Enter “minio/minio” as the image name under **Image Repository** and select _Kill existing pods before creating new ones_ under **Update Strategy**.

<br><br>

Now you need to configure your container arguments (args) to set up your cluster. Start by entering the “server” argument, and then follow it up with the IP address/hostnames of your various nodes. Keep in mind that the order is important and should be used across all the nodes identically. The IP/Hostname should be the valid address of your individual TrueNAS systems on the network. The _/data_ path should be used and will be set up in the next steps.

Next, you will need to create Container Environment Variables and define your MINIO_ACCESS_KEY and MINIO_SECRET_KEY values. Make sure these are identical between nodes and fill the **Environment Variable Value** with proper random credentials.

In the **Networking** section, be sure to select _Host Network_, then click **NEXT** until you reach the **Host Path Volumes** section.

<br><br>

In the **Host Path Volumes** section, select the directory or dataset you created earlier and enter the `/data` directory under **Mount Path**, then click **NEXT**.

<br><br>

Confirm your options, then click **SUBMIT** to complete the first node.

<br><br>

Now that the first node is complete, you can create datasets for any remaining nodes.

## Accessing your minio distributed setup

Once you're done creating datasets, you can browse to any of the TrueNAS addresses at port `:9000`, where you will be greeted by the MinIO login screen. Log in with the Access/Secret keys you set up in the previous steps. You should now be able to access your MinIO distributed setup.
