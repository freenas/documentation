**Storage** > **VMware-Snapshots** is used to coordinate ZFS snapshots when using TrueNAS as a VMware datastore.
When a ZFS snapshot is created, TrueNAS automatically snapshots any running VMware virtual machines before taking a scheduled or manual ZFS snapshot of the dataset or zvol backing that VMware datastore.
Virtual machines **must be powered on** for TrueNAS snapshots to be copied to VMware.
The temporary VMware snapshots are then deleted on the VMware side but still exist in the ZFS snapshot and can be used as stable resurrection points in that snapshot.
These coordinated snapshots are listed in the **Storage** > **Snapshots** list.

## Creating a VMware Snapshot

Go to **Storage** > **VMware Snapshots** and click **ADD** to create a new VMware snapshot.

| Setting        | Value          | Description                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hostname       | string         | Enter the IP address or hostname of the VMware host. When clustering, use the IP address or hostname of the vCenter server for the cluster.     |
| Username       | string         | Enter a user account name created on the VMware host. The account must have permission to snapshot virtual machines.                            |
| Password       | string         | Enter the password associated with the `Username`.                                                                                                    |
| ZFS Filesystem | browse button  | Select a filesystem to snapshot.                                                                                                           |
| Datastore      | drop-down menu | After entering the `Hostname`, `Username`, and `Password`, click `FETCH DATASTORES` to populate the menu, then select the datastore to be synchronized. |

TrueNAS connects to the VMware host after entering credentials and clicking **FETCH DATASTORES**.
The `ZFS Filesystem` and `Datastore` drop-down menus are then populated with information from the VMware host.
Choosing a datastore also selects any previously mapped dataset.
