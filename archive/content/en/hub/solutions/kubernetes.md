The open source community has made a container storage interface (CSI) Kubernetes driver available for integration with TrueNAS!
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is "an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications."
The TrueNAS integration drivers available from https://github.com/democratic-csi/democratic-csi are focused on providing storage using iSCSI, NFS, and SMB protocols and include several ZFS features like snapshots, cloning, and resizing.
There is also a framework for open source contributors to create their own CSI drivers.
