## RMA Policy

All warranted systems inherit the iXsystems RMA policy. The details of the policy vary depending upon the type of system and whether or not it is located in the continental US.

**Domestic RMA Policy**: Advanced Replacement + Return Shipping Label (time limited to 14 days). Return label is time limited and the faulty part must arrive at iXsystems within 14 days to avoid an automated invoice for the full cost of the replacement part.

**TrueNAS International RMA Policy**: Advanced Replacement + Return Shipping Label (time limited to 30 days). Return label is time limited and the faulty part must arrive at iX within 30 days of swapping the faulty unit to avoid an automated invoice for the full cost of the replacement part.

**FreeNAS/Server International RMA Policy**: Advanced Replacement; customer responsible for returning failed component (no shipping label). Parts must be received by iXsystems within 30 days to avoid an automated invoice for the full cost of the replacement part.
