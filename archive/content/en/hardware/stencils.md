TrueNAS stencils allow diagramming how your TrueNAS hardware is configured and wired in your network environment.
The stencils have anchor points for each hardware connection.
They are also customizable, with drop-in functionality for the expansion cards available from [iXsystems](https://www.ixsystems.com).

You will need Microsoft Visio or another application that can open <file>.vssx</file> files to use this stencil pack.
To download the stencils, hover over the reference image and click the button.
