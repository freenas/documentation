{{< toc >}}

An automatic script sends a nightly email to the administrator (*root*) account containing important information such as the health of the disks.
Alert events are also emailed to the root user account.
Configure the system to send these emails to the administratorâ€™s remote email account for fast awareness and resolution of any critical issues.

{{< hint info >}}
[Scrub Task]({{< relref "ScrubTasks.md" >}}) issues and [S.M.A.R.T. reports]({{< relref "SMARTTests.md" >}}) are mailed separately to the address configured in those services.

Go to **Accounts > Users**, click <i class="fa fa-ellipsis-v" aria-hidden="true" title="Options"></i> (Options) and *Edit* for the `root` user.
In the *Email* field, enter a remote email address that is regularly monitored by the system administrator, like *admin@example.com* and click *SAVE*.

## Email Options

The remaining configuration is done from **System > Email**.
