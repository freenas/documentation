The disk *Name* (da1, da2, ada4) helps confirm that you have selected the right disk to wipe

The *Method* dropdown shows the different available wipe options available:

{{< tabs "Wipe Methods" >}}
{{< tab "Quick" >}}
Erases only the partitioning information on a disk, making it easy to reuse but without clearing other old data. Quick wipes take only a few seconds.
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Full with zeros" >}}
Overwrites the entire disk with zeros and can take several hours to complete.
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Full with random" >}}
Overwrites the entire disk with random binary code and takes even longer than **Full with zeros** to complete.
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

{{< hint danger >}}
Ensure all data is backed up and the disk is no longer in use.
Triple check that the correct disk is selected for the wipe.
Recovering data from a wiped disk is usually impossible.

**Verify the name to ensure you have the correct disk chosen**.
When satisfied the disk can be wiped, set *Confirm* and click *CONTINUE*.
A dialog shows the wipe progress.
