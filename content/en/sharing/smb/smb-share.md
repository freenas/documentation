## Introduction

If sharing a lot of data securely with many users is the goal, then setting up
an SMB share can help. SMB shares allow the management and administration
of large or small pools of data. The brilliant design of the TrueNAS web
interface makes it easy to create and configure an SMB share. SMB shares can be
connected to any major operating systems including Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

To get started, make sure a
<a href="/docs/initial-setup/storage/datasets/">dataset has been created</a>.
This dataset serves as the storage for the data that is going to be
shared. Next, activate the SMB service, create the share, and configure
permissions for the share.

## SMB Service

To turn the SMB service on, go to **Services** and click the slider for
*SMB*. If you wish to turn the service to activate whenever TrueNAS
boots, check the *Start Automatically* box.

> NOTE: The SMB share will not work if the service is not turned on.

The SMB service settings can be configured by clicking
<i class="fas fa-pen"></i>. Don't forget to click *SAVE* when changing
the settings. Unless a specific setting is needed, it is recommended to
use the default settings for the SMB service.

## SMB Share

Now create the Windows SMB share. Go to
**Sharing > Windows Shares (SMB)** and click **ADD**. The only required
field to continue is the *Path*. Set the path to the pool or dataset you
want to share by entering a path in the field or clicking a directory in
the file browser. A descriptive *Name* helps identify the share.
Otherwise, TrueNAS automatically assigns the name of the pool or dataset
shared to the name of the SMB share. A *Purpose* can be defined for the
share. The *Purpose* is a preset for settings of the share. Depending on
the purpose chosen, TrueNAS adjusts the settings of the share based off
the purpose chosen. For example, if you chose *Private SMB Datasets and
Shares*, TrueNAS automatically tunes some settings so the share can be
used as a private share. An optional *Description* can be
specified to help explain the purpose of the share. For a more granular
configuration, click **ADVANCED MODE**.

After changing the desired settings, click **SAVE**.

## Define Share Access

Users connecting to the SMB share must have user accounts on the TrueNAS
before they can connect. Add user accounts by going to
**Accounts > Users > ADD**. <!-- Can insert links here to "How to create users/groups when they're complete. -->

To create groups for users, go to **Accounts > Groups > ADD**. Creating groups
and assigning users to those groups can make configuring permissions much more
efficient. To assign users to a group go to **Accounts > Groups**, select
a group from the list, and click *MEMBERS*. <!-- For more information on configuring users, go to <a href="">Creating Users</a>. For more information on configuring groups, go to <a href="">Creating Groups</a>.-->

If LDAP has been configured and you want users from the LDAP server to be
allowed to access the SMB share, set **Samba Schema** in
**Directory Services > LDAP > ADVANCED MODE**.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
If the LDAP setting **Samba Schema** is enabled, then the local TrueNAS user
accounts cannot be used to connect to the share. Only user accounts configured
on the LDAP server can connect to the share.
{{% /alert %}}

### Edit ACLs

The final step for setting up a general purpose SMB share is to control the
permissions of the users accessing the share. After an SMB share has been
created, it appears in the **Sharing > Windows Shares (SMB)** list. Go to the
list and click
**<i class="fa fa-ellipsis-v" aria-hidden="true"></i> > Edit ACL** for the
desired share. Here you can change permissions for *owner@*, *group@*, and
*everyone@*. New permissions for specific users or groups can also be defined
by clicking *ADD ACL ITEM*. For more information on configuring ACLs, see
<a href="/docs/tasks/advanced/editingacls/">Managing Access Control Lists</a>.
