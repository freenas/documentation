## Introduction

TrueNASÂ® supports a ZFS feature known as multiple boot environments. With
multiple boot environments, the process of updating the operating system becomes
a low-risk operation. The updater automatically creates a snapshot of the
current boot environment and adds it to the boot menu before applying the
update.

## Boot Environments

To view the list of boot environments on the system, go to **System > Boot**.
Each boot environment entry contains this information:

- **Name**: the name of the boot entry as it will appear in the boot menu.
- **Active**: indicates which entry will boot by default if a boot environment
  has not been selected as active.
- **Created**: indicates the date and time the boot entry was created.
- **Space**: displays the size of the boot environment.
- **Keep**: indicates whether or not this boot environment can be pruned if an
  update does not have enough space to proceed.

To access more options for a boot environment, click <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v"></i>.
The options are as follows:

- **Activate**: only appears on entries which are not currently set to Active.
  Changes the selected entry to the default boot entry on next boot. The status
  changes to Reboot and the current Active entry changes from Now/Reboot to Now,
  indicating that it was used on the last boot but will not be used on the next boot.
- **Clone**: makes a new boot environment from the selected boot environment.
  When prompted for the name of the clone, alphanumeric characters, dashes (-),
  underscores (_), and periods (.) are allowed.
- **Rename**: used to change the name of the boot environment. Alphanumeric
  characters, dashes (-), underscores (_), and periods (.) are allowed.
- **Delete**: used to delete the highlighted entry, which also removes that
  entry from the boot menu. Since an activated entry cannot be deleted, this
  button does not appear for the active boot environment. To delete an entry
  that is currently activated, first activate another entry. Note that this
  button does not appear for the default boot environment as this entry is
  needed to return the system to the original installation state.
- **Keep**: used to toggle whether or not the updater can prune (automatically
  delete) this boot environment if there is not enough space to proceed with
  the update.

Click *ACTIONS* to:

- **Add**: make a new boot environment from the active environment. The active
  boot environment contains the text Now/Reboot in the Active column. Only
  alphanumeric characters, dashes (-), and underscores (_) are allowed in the name.
- **Stats/Settings**: display statistics for the operating system device:
  condition, total and used size, and date and time of the last scrub.
  By default, the operating system device is scrubbed every 7 days. To change
  the default, input a different number in the *Automatic scrub interval
  (in days)* field and click *UPDATE INTERVAL*.
- **Boot Pool Status**: display the status of each device in the operating
  system device (boot-pool), including any read, write, or checksum errors.
- **Scrub Boot Pool**: perform a manual scrub of the operating system device.

## Changing Boot Environment in the Web Interface

Sometimes, rolling back to an older boot environment can be useful. For example,
if an update process doesn't go as planned, it is easy to roll back to a
previous boot environment. TrueNAS automatically creates a boot environment when
the system updates. To activate a previous boot environment, go to
**System > Boot** and click <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-v"></i> for the desired
boot environment. Next, click *Activate*. The boot environment that was
activated will now have *Reboot* displayed in the *Active* column. This means
that the boot environment will become active on the next reboot.

> NOTE: When changing the boot environment, the system configuration also
> changes to the state it was in when the boot environment was created.

## Changing Boot Environment in the Welcome CLI

If for some reason the web interface is unaccessible but physical access to the
system is not, the boot environment can be changed at the welcome screen of the CLI.
Reboot the system. When the welcome screen appears press the key that
corresponds with the option *Boot Environments*. In the picture below, the key
to select the *Boot Environments* option is <kbd>7</kbd>.

> NOTE: The *Boot Environments* options doesn't appear when there are no extra
> boot environments on the system.

After selecting the *Boot Environment* option, choose the new boot environment
to activate. Press the corresponding key for the *Active:* option. In the picture
below, the key is <kbd>2</kbd>.

Press the key to cycle through existing boot
environments. When the desired boot environment is selected, press
<kbd>Backspace</kbd> to return to the welcome menu. Then, press <kbd>4</kbd> to
reboot the system. When the system reboots, it will boot into the boot
environment selected earlier.
