title: "Sequential Scrub and Resilver Adjustments"
description: "How to adjust the scrub and resilver settings or revert to a legacy algorithm."

Beginning with the release of FreeNAS 11.1, the algorithm used for scrubs and resilvers received many performance improvements, most noticeably on fragmented pools.

## Issue: Legacy Behavior

Some users might wish to revert to the old algorithm for scrub and resilver.

### Fix: Revert to Old Behavior

The legacy scrub algorithm can be enabled by setting this **sysctl** tunable in the *Shell* console:

`sysctl -w vfs.zfs.zfs_scan_legacy=1`

> If a scrub is already in progress, it can be paused, the tunable set, and the scrub resumed with these commands:
> `zpool scrub -p poolname`,
> `sysctl -w vfs.zfs.zfs_scan_legacy=1`, and
> `zpool scrub poolname`

## Issue: System Load During Scrubs or Resilvers

In FreeNAS 11.1 and 11.1-U1, resilver and scrub delays were both set to *0*. This can keep the system too busy to do other work when a scrub or resilver is active.

### Fix: Adjust Scrub and Silver Delay Settings

Two **sysctl** tunables affect scrub and resilver speed and system availability:

`vfs.zfs.resilver_delay`

`vfs.zfs.scrub_delay`

Setting the resilver delay to *2* and the scrub delay to *4* limits the IOPS used for these functions, providing some reserve for normal operations:

`sysctl vfs.zfs.resilver_delay=2`

`sysctl vfs.zfs.scrub_delay=4`
