TrueNAS provides the luxury of reporting the temperature of all active disks in
the system. Click *Reporting* to view the reporting page. Select *Disk* from
the drop-down on the top left of the page. The default view shows a temperature
graph of the first disk. To see the temperature graphs of more disks, select
them from the *DEVICES* drop-down. To view other metrics such as *Disk I/O* and
*Disk Latency*, select them from the *METRICS* drop-down. Graphs can
be interacted with by clicking and dragging on a certain range, or by clicking
<i class="fas fa-search-plus"></i>, <i class="fas fa-search-minus"></i>,
<i class="fas fa-forward"></i>, or <i class="fas fa-backward"></i>.
