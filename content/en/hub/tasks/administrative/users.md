description: "A how-to for managing users in TrueNAS."
---

Users can be created or added to the TrueNAS system, allowing flexibility in
configuring which users have access to the data stored on the system. A common
practice is to create users and assign them to
<a href="/docs/tasks/administrative/groups/">groups</a>. This practice allows for
easy and efficient permission tuning. If the network uses a directory service,
import the existing account information using the instructions in
<a href="/docs/initial-setup/directory-services/">Directory Services</a>.

> NOTE: TrueNAS hides all builtin users by default. To show all builtin users,
> go to **Accounts > Users** and click <i class="fas fa-cog"></i>.

## Identification

To create a user, go to **Accounts > Users** and click *ADD*. Enter the full
name of the user. The username is set based off the full name. However, the
username can be changed if desired. An optional email can be associated with
an user account. Set a password for the user.

## User ID and Groups

Next, a user ID must be set. TrueNAS automatically sets the user ID starting at
1000. The user ID can be changed if desired. It is recommended to use an ID of
1000 or more for non-builtin users. By default, TrueNAS creates a new primary
group with the same name as the user. To add the user to an existing primary
group, unset *New Primary Group* and select an existing group from the
*Primary Group* drop-down. The user can be added to additional groups using the
*Auxillary Groups* drop-down.

## Directories and Permissions

When creating a user, a home directory path of /nonexistent is set. This does
not create a home directory for the user. To set a home directory for the user,
select a path using the file browser. If the directory exists and matches the
username, it is set as the user's home directory. When the path does not end
with a subdirectory matching the username, a new subdirectory is created. The
full path to the user's home directory is shown here when editing a user.
Directly under the file browser, the home directory permissions can be set.

## Authentication

A public SSH key can be assigned to a user for key based authentication. Just
paste the **public** key into the *SSH Public Key* field. If you are using an
SSH public key, it is always a good idea to keep a backup of the key.
Click *DOWNLOAD SSH PUBLIC KEY* to download the pasted key as a `.txt` file.
If *Disable Password* is set to *Yes*, it disables the *Password* field and
removes the password from the account. The account cannot use password-based
logins for services. For example, disabling the password prevents using account
credentials to log in to an SMB share or open an SSH session on the system.
The *Lock User* and *Permit Sudo* options are also removed. By default, it is
set to *No*. A specific shell can be set for the user from the *Shell*
drop-down.
