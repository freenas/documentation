TrueNAS can be installed inside a virtual machine using an `.iso` file.
To get the latest version of TrueNAS go to the
[TrueNAS website](https://www.truenas.com/ "TrueNAS Website") and
download TrueNAS Core. The next step is to install it into a VM.

## Virtual Machine Application

Since TrueNAS is built and provided as an `.iso` file, it will work on
all virtual machine applications (VMware, VirtualBox, Citrix
Hypervisor, etc). In this document,
[VMware Workstation Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html)
for Windows is being used.

{{% alert title="Recommended Minimum Virtual Machine Settings:" %}}
What ever virtualization application is used, ensure these minimum
virtual machine settings are met.

* RAM: at least 8192MB (8GB)
* DISKS: one virtual disk with at least 8GB for the operating system
and boot environments and at least one additional virtual disk with
at least 4GB to be used as data storage.
* NETWORK: Use NAT, Bridged, or Host-only depending on your host network
configuration.

## Installing

> NOTE: VMware Player 15.5 for Windows is being used in this example.

Open VMware Player and click *Create a New Virtual Machine* to enter
the New Virtual Machine Wizard.

### 1. Installer disk image file

Select the *Installer disk image file (iso)* option, click *Browse...*,
and upload the TrueNAS Core `.iso` file that was downloaded earlier.

### 2. Name the Virtual Machine

In this step, the virtual machine name and location can be changed.

### 3. Specify Disk Capacity

Specify the maximum disk size for the initial disk. The default value
of 20GB is enough for TrueNAS. Next, select *Store virtual disk as a
single file*.

### 4. Review Virtual Machine

Review the virtual machine configuration before proceeding. By default,
VMware Player doesn't set enough RAM for the virtual machine. Click
*Customize Hardware...* > *Memory*. Drag the slider up to 8GB and click
*Ok*. If you wish to power on the machine after creation, select *Power
on this virtual machine after creation*.

## Add Virtual Disk for Storage

After the virtual machine has been created, select it from the virtual
machine list and click *Edit virtual machine settings*. Click
*Add...* and select *Hard Disk*. Select *SCSI* as the virtual disk
type. Select *Create a new virtual disk*. Specify the maximum size
of this additional virtual disk. This disk will be used for data
storage. If desired, allocate the disk space immediately by setting
*Allocate all disk space now*. Select *Store virtual disk as single
file*. Finally, name and chose a location for the new virtual disk.

## TrueNAS Installer

Select the virtual machine from the list and click *Play virtual
machine*. The machine will start and boot into the TrueNAS installer.
Select *Install/Upgrade*.
