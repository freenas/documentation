The **Reports** page is used to customize charts of system metrics for data analysis.

These reports are created by or shared with the current TrueCommand user.
There are default reports that are designed to generate a basic system overview chart.
These show details like network traffic, storage, and memory utilization for the chosen system.

Viewing a report requires that the user has access to the systems that are being analyzed.

## Creating a Report

Click **+ CREATE REPORT** to create a customizable report.
Enter a report name and an optional description for the report.
Click BROWSE WIDGETS or WIDGET to add charts to the report.

### Custom Charts

Most charts are already configured to report certain settings.
To create a custom chart with custom settings, add a *Custom Area Chart*, *Custom Bar Chart*, or *Custom Line Chart*.
Fill in these options when adding a custom chart:

* General settings: Enter a Title, Subtitle (optional), Axis label (optional), Point size, Line size, Y min (optional), and Y max (optional) for the chart.
  `Stack the values` can be set to bring data points on the chart closer together.
  This setting is useful for charts that have many different data points at the max Y value.
* Data sources: Add data sources to the chart by expanding a category and selecting appropriate sources.
  Multiple data sources can be added to one chart.
* Summary: This step shows the all of the chosen values.
  Click **SAVE** to add the custom chart to the report or **BACK** to go back and change a setting or data source.

After adding charts to the report, click **SAVE** to make this report available for use.

## Share Report

By default, the reports created by a user are available only to that user.
To share a report with other users or teams, open the **User Menu ‣ Reports** screen and click the **Share** button for a report.
Reports can also be shared after clicking **Generate report (Eye)**.

Reports can be shared with individual users or entire teams.
Set either **OWNER** or **SHARED WITH** for the desired user.
Users with the **SHARED WITH** status can view the report, while the **OWNER** status allows that user to edit the report.
Clicking the **OWNER** or **SHARED WITH** text toggles every name in the list.

## Viewing a System Report

Open the **User Menu ‣ Reports** page and click **Generate report (Eye)** on the appropriate report.
Click **GENERATE** to select the systems and time frame for the report
