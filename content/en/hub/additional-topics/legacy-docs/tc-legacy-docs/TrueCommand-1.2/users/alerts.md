TrueCommand alerts provide visual warnings for monitored systems that require attention.
These alerts are either generated by the monitored system or an alert rule created in TrueCommand.

## Viewing All Alerts

To see all alerts that TrueCommand has discovered, open the **User Menu** and click **All Alerts**.
Administrator accounts can see all generated alerts.
A non-administrator account can only view alerts according to their team and user account permissions.

<br><br>

The **Active Alerts** tab shows all unresolved alerts.
Alerts are moved to the **Resolved Alerts** tab by clicking **Resolve (Check)**.
To resolve multiple alerts, select each alert and click **Resolve (Check)**.

Click **View alert notice details (`i`)** to view any user comments about an alert.

Administrator accounts can delete an alert by clicking **Delete (Trash Can)**.
Deleting an alert cannot be undone.
To delete multiple alerts, select each alert and click **Delete (Trash Can)**.

### Viewing Alerts by System

Alerts generated by a monitored system display in both the administrative **Systems** screen and the **Dashboard** as a number above the system icon.
To view all alerts for to a single system, go to the **Dashboard**, select a single system, and click the **Alerts** tab.

<br><br>

Each active and resolved alert for that system is visible in this tab.
Clicking **View alert notice details (`i`)** shows details for that alert, including the option to leave comments about the alert.

## Managing Alert Rules

Alerts in TrueCommand are generated from alert rules.
Several default rules are built into TrueCommand.
TrueCommand administrators and [team members]({{< relref "../admins/users.md#configuring-teams" >}}) with the appropriate permissions can create new alert rules.

To view all TrueCommand alert rules, open the **User Menu** and click **Alert Rules**.

<br><br>

Details about each TrueCommand alert rule are shown on this page, including which user account created the rule.
Alert rules can be activated, suspended, edited, or deleted by either an administrator account or the account that created the rule.

New TrueCommand alert rules can be created to monitor a wide variety of system information and generate a TrueCommand alert if specific conditions occur.
To create a new alert rule, click **+ NEW ALERT RULE** and follow the creation wizard:

<br><br>

* Select a System: The rule will apply to these systems.
  Appropriate system permissions are required for non-administrative user accounts.
* Select a Data Source: Choose a data source for the rule.
  This is the type of information that can trigger an alert.
  For example, choosing *cpu_temp* means the alert rule monitors the temperature of the chosen system.
* Type and Threshold: Create the rule conditions:
  * Data type: This is the specific data TrueCommand will monitor.
    The options change depending on the **Data Source**.
  * Priority level: Choose *Information*, *Warning*, or *Critical*.
    This determines the category of alerts generated by this rule.
  * Comparison type: A conditional statement that applies to the **Data type** and the **Comparison value**.
  * Comparison value: Enter a value appropriate to the options scenario and options selected.
    This can act as a threshold or limitation on when an alert is generated by the rule.
* Finished: To create the new alert rule, click **CREATE ALERT**. To start over, click **RESET**.

## Configuring Alert Services

TrueCommand uses different services to expand how alerts are communicated to individual users or administrators.
Individual user accounts can use these services to manage how that account is notified of an alert.
To configure an alert service plugin, open the **User Menu** and click **Alert Services**.

Each service has different configuration options, but each can be tested to ensure your settings are working correctly.
