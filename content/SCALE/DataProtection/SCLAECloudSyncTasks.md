TrueNAS can send, receive, or synchronize data with a Cloud Storage provider. Cloud Sync tasks allow for single time transfers or recurring transfers on a schedule and are an effective method to back up data to a remote location.

{{< hint warning >}}
Using the Cloud means that data can go to a third party commercial vendor not directly affiliated with iXsystems. Please investigate and fully understand that vendorâ€™s pricing policies and services before creating any Cloud Sync task. iXsystems is not responsible for any charges incurred from the use of third party vendors with the Cloud Sync feature.
{{< /hint >}}

TrueNAS supports major providers like Amazon S3, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, along with a variety of other vendors. To see the full list of supported vendors, go to **Credentials > Backup Credentials > Cloud Credentials** click *Add* and open the *Provider* dropdown.

## Requirements

* All system [Storage](/scale/storage/) must be configured and ready to receive or send data.
* A Cloud Storage provider account and a cloud storage location, like an Amazon S3 bucket, must be available.
* Cloud Storage account credentials must be saved to **System > Cloud Credentials** before creating the sync task. See *Cloud Credentials* for specific instructions.

## Creating a Cloud Sync Task

Go to **Data Protection > Cloud Sync Tasks** and click *Add*.

![DataProtectionCloudSyncAdd](/images/SCALE/DataProtectionCloudSyncAdd.png "Creating a Cloud Sync Task")

Give the task a memorable *Description* and select an existing cloud *Credential*. TrueNAS connects to the chosen Cloud Storage Provider and shows the available storage locations. Decide if data is transferring to (*PUSH*) or from (*PULL*) the Cloud Storage location (**Remote**). Choose a *Transfer Mode*:

{{< tabs "Transfer Modes" >}}
{{< tab "Sync" >}}
*Sync* keeps all the files identical between the two storage locations. If the sync encounters an error, files are not deleted in the destination.
This includes a common error when the [Dropbox copyright detector](https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/30/how-dropbox-knows-when-youre-sharing-copyrighted-stuff-without-actually-looking-at-your-stuff/) flags a file as copyrighted.

Note that syncing to a Backblaze B2 bucket does not delete files from the bucket, even when those files have been deleted locally. Instead, files are tagged with a version number or moved to a hidden state. To automatically delete old or unwanted files from the bucket, adjust the [Backblaze B2 Lifecycle Rules](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-b2-lifecycle-rules/).

Files stored in Amazon S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive cannot be deleted by a sync. These files must first be restored by another means, like the [Amazon S3 console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/restore-archived-objects.html).
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Copy" >}}
*Copy* duplicates each source file into the destination, _overwriting_ any files in the destination that have the same name as the source. Copying is the least potentially destructive option.
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Move" >}}
*Move* transfers the files from the source to the destination and _deletes_ the original source files. Files with the same names on the destination are overwritten.

Next, **Control** when the task runs by defining a *Schedule*. When a specific *Schedule* is required, choose *Custom* and use the **Advanced Scheduler**.

{{< expand "Advanced Scheduler" "v" >}}
{{< include file="static/includes/AdvancedScheduler.md.part" markdown="true" >}}
{{< /expand >}}

Unsetting *Enable* makes the configuration available without allowing the *Schedule* to run the task. To manually activate a saved task, go to **Data Protection > Cloud Sync Tasks**, click <i class="fa fa-play" aria-hidden="true"></i> for the cloud sync task you want to run.  You will be prompted to *CONTINUE* or *CANCEL* the *Run Now* operation.

The remaining options allow tuning the task to your specific requirements.

{{< expand "Specific Options" "v" >}}
{{< include file="static/includes/TasksCloudSyncAddFields.md.part" markdown="true" >}}

### Scripting and Environment Variables

Advanced users can write scripts that run immediately *before* or *after* the Cloud Sync task. The **Post-script** field is only run when the Cloud Sync task successfully completes. You can pass a variety of task environment variables into the **Pre-** and **Post-** script fields:

* `CLOUD_SYNC_ID`
* `CLOUD_SYNC_DESCRIPTION`
* `CLOUD_SYNC_DIRECTION`
* `CLOUD_SYNC_TRANSFER_MODE`
* `CLOUD_SYNC_ENCRYPTION`
* `CLOUD_SYNC_FILENAME_ENCRYPTION`
* `CLOUD_SYNC_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD`
* `CLOUD_SYNC_ENCRYPTION_SALT`
* `CLOUD_SYNC_SNAPSHOT`

There also are provider-specific variables like CLOUD_SYNC_CLIENT_ID or CLOUD_SYNC_TOKEN or CLOUD_SYNC_CHUNK_SIZE.

Remote storage settings:
* `CLOUD_SYNC_BUCKET`
* `CLOUD_SYNC_FOLDER`

Local storage settings:
* `CLOUD_SYNC_PATH`

### Testing Settings

Test the settings before saving by clicking *Dry Run*. TrueNAS connects to the Cloud Storage Provider and simulates a file transfer. No data is actually sent or received.
A dialog shows the test status and allows downloading the task logs. This is also ran by clicking <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Dry Run">loop</i> after the task is created.

![DataProtectionCloudSyncAddBoxDryRun](/images/SCALE/DataProtectionCloudSyncDryRun.png "Example: Box Drive Test")

## Cloud Sync Behavior

Saved tasks activate according to their schedule or by clicking <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Run Now">play_arrow</i>. An in-progress cloud sync must finish before another can begin. Stopping an in-progress task cancels the file transfer and requires starting the file transfer over.

To view logs about a running or the most recent run of a task, click the task *State*.

## Cloud Sync Restore

To quickly create a new Cloud Sync that uses the same options but reverses the data transfer, select <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Restore">history</i> for an existing Cloud Sync on the **Data Protection** page.

![DataProtectionsCloudSyncRestore](/images/SCALE/DataProtectionCloudSyncRestore.png "Cloud Sync Restore")

Enter a new *Description* for this reversed task, define the path to a storage location for the transferred data and click *Restore*.

The restored cloud sync is saved as another entry in **Data protection > Cloud Sync Tasks**.

In case the restore destination dataset is the same as the original source dataset, the restored files might have their ownership altered to *root*. If the original files were not created by *root* and a different owner is required, you can recursively reset ACL Permissions of the restored dataset through the GUI or by running `chown` from the CLI.
