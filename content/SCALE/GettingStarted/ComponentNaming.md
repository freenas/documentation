TreuNAS SCALE incorporates all the major TrueNAS CORE storage and sharing features with a web interface based on Debian GNU/Linux.  Because SCALE shares the same UI as the FreeBSD-based TrueNAS CORE, users will notice there are similarities, however, SCALE does incorporate some differences, primarlily in component naming.

## Disks

TrueNAS Core utilizes a numerical listing of drives in a system.
