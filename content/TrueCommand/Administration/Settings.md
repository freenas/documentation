This page is available to users with administrator permissions by opening the **Configure** <i class="fa fa-cog" aria-hidden="true" title="Settings"></i> menu and clicking *Administration*.
The page is organized into **About**, **Certificates**, and **Configuration** tabs.

### Updating the License

You can expand TrueCommand to monitor more disks by upgrading or purchasing a license from iXsystems.
Clicking *GET A LICENSE* opens a new browser tab to purchase a TrueCommand license.
You can also contact iXsystems to upgrade the current license.

After you purchase or upgrade the license, you must upload the new license to TrueCommand.
Click *Browseâ€¦* to open a file browser on your local system.
Select the new license file to upload and click *UPLOAD LICENSE* to apply the new license to TrueCommand.
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Certificates" >}}
The **Certificates** tab shows the certificates and Certificate Authorities (CAs) TrueCommand uses and has options to upload or import a certificate or CA.

Clicking *Browse...* opens a dialog to upload a file from the local system.
Selecting *Plain text* allows you to copy and paste the file raw text instead of uploading a file.
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Configuration" >}}
The Configuration tab contains options to configure various features of TrueCommand.

Changing any options requires clicking *SAVE* to save the new system configuration.
To reset fields back to their previous values, click *CANCEL*.

General options include how frequently TrueCommand measures systems statistics, how long to store system statistics, and the number of database backups from an iXsystems NAS to store.

### SSL options

This section has options to configure secure connections.
By default, TrueCommand attempts an SSL connection, then a non-SSL connection if the first attempt fails.
You can disable non-SSL connection attempts by setting *Require SSL for all connections*.
This is useful when a monitored system does not allow SSL-secured access or when the monitored system is using a custom port.

There are additional options to configure how TrueCommand handles certificates.
By default, TrueCommand accepts self-signed certificates and certificate hostname mismatches.
This allows the first-time login to TrueCommand and accepting certificates from systems that use a hostname, but are registered in TrueCommand with an IP address (or vice-versa).

### Alert Options

You can adjust the alert levels that TrueCommand shows from a connected NAS to tune the system messages shown according to your use case.
Choose an alert category to ignore.
Multiple categories can be selected.

### LDAP

TrueCommand supports using [LDAP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4511) to better integrate within an established network environment.
To configure LDAP, add an LDAP server IP address or DNS hostname, fill in the *Domain*, then click *ADD SERVER*.
You can add Multiple LDAP servers and Domains.

Enabling *Allow LDAP user creation* means TrueCommand creates user accounts when someone logs in to the User Interface with their LDAP credentials.
*JOIN TEAM* automatically adds LDAP users to specific TrueCommand teams.
