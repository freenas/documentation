Teams are collections of users with permissions that apply to all the joined user accounts.
Teams provide a more efficient way of managing large numbers of or related user accounts.
For example, changing the permissions of a *Metrics* team that has 20 joined user accounts is much faster than changing the permissions for each account.


## Organizing User Teams

To create a team, open the **Configure** <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Settings">settings</i> menu and click **TEAMS**

![TeamsList](/images/TrueCommand/1.3/TeamsList.png "Teams List")

Clicking **NEW TEAM** will open a popout menu.

Enter a name and select an avatar for the new team.
You can edit the permissions for a team after creating it.

### Configuring Teams

To create a team, open the **Configure** <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Settings">settings</i> menu and click **TEAMS**
To adjust the team members or permissions, click the Edit button <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Configure">edit</i>.

![Teams Edit](/images/TrueCommand/1.3/TeamsEdit.png "Teams Edit")

You can adjust the team profile with a new avatar, change the team name, or grant team members permission to create new TrueCommand Alert Rules.

The **Members** section shows which user accounts are included in the team.
To add users to the team, click *ADD USER* and choose them from the drop-down.
To remove users from the team, click *- (minus)* on the desired user.

System permissions are configured exactly the same way as described above for individual user accounts.
Note that individual user account permissions can override team permissions.

## Deleting Teams

To delete an account details and permissions, open the *Configure* <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Settings">settings</i>menu and click **Teams**
When the users page loads, click the delete button <i class="material-icons" aria-hidden="true" title="Delete">delete</i> to the right of the user you wish to delete.
A popup will appear to confirm deletion of the Team.
