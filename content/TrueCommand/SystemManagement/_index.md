The TrueCommand dashboard gives a quick overview of the status of the TrueNAS systems it has been connected to.

For information on the Top Bar and the options refer to [Interface Overview]({{< relref "/TrueCommand/TCGettingStarted/InterfaceOverview.md" >}}) article in the Getting Started Documentation.

### System Cards

Each system has a unique card to display statistics.
When the system has an alert, an *Alerts* bubble appears next to the system version to show how many alerts there are for that specific system.
See [Alert Management]({{< relref "/TrueCommand/Alerts/AlertManage.md" >}}) for further information.

Clicking the system name on the card shows an expanded view of the system with more [Single System Management options]({{< relref "/TrueCommand/SystemManagement/SingleSystem/_index.md" >}}).

#### Options Menu

The Options menu gives you several shortcuts to simple tasks.  **Edit** opens the edit window for the connection details for the TrueNAS and the nickname. **Update** initiates an update of the TrueNAS system. **NAS Portal** will open up a new tab for the full TrueNAS Web UI.  **iSCSI Volumes** opens up the iSCSI management page for the specific TrueNAS.  **Services** opens up the services page allowing a user direct control over current service status and enabling or disabling service autostart.  **Delete** will remove the system from TrueCommand.  Delete will not delete any data stored on the TrueNAS system, however Delete will delete all system metrics history saved in TrueCommand's database.
