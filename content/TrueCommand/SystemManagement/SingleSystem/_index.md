While TrueCommand allows users to manage all of their systems on a single dashboard, it also lets users view single systems at a time. 

To manage a single system either click the name of the system in the system card or click the dashboard drop-down menu, hover over *Ungrouped*, and select the system you want to manage.

While viewing a single system, users can see various statistics like CPU, Memory, and Storage usage, as well as existing datasets and [alerts]({{< relref "AlertManage.md" >}}).

Users can also create and manage storage, snapshots, and shares using the File Explorer. 

Users with adequate permissions may update the system, [configure backups]({{< relref "TrueNASConfigManage.md" >}}), and generate system audits and [reports]({{< relref "Creation.md" >}}).
